# Obama' speech for Biden
  
<font size=10>T</font>his president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored. But you know what, the job doesn't work that way. Tweeting at the television doesn't fix things. Making stuff up doesn't make people's lives better. You've got to have a plan, you've got to put in the work. Donald Trump isn't suddenly gonna protect all of us. He can't even take the basic steps to protect himself. Just last night he complained up in Erie that the pandemic made him go back to work, I'm quoting him. He was upset that the pandemic's made him go back to work. If he'd actually been working the whole time, it never would've gotten this bad. And with Joe and Kamala at the helm, you're not gonna have to think about the crazy things they said every day. And that's worth a lot. You're not gonna have to argue about them every day. It just won't be so exhausting. You might be able to have a Thanksgiving dinner without having an argument. You'll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not gonna retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or that maybe SEALs didn't actually kill Bin Laden. Think about that. The president of the United States retweeted that.~~Imagine. What? What?~~ We're not gonna have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn't support him or threaten them with jail. That's not normal presidential behavior. We wouldn't tolerate it from a high school principal. We wouldn't tolerate it from a coach. we wouldn't tolerate it from a co-worker. We wouldn't tolerate it in our family, except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere. ~~You know, he is...~~

<font size=10>P</font>eople ask me sometimes, they say: "Man, how have you been able to take these last four years just watching all this?" "How do you keep your spirits up?" And I tell him, I say, look for all the times, these last four years that we've seen our worst impulses revealed, we've also seen what our country can be at its best. We've seen folks of every age and background who've packed city centers and airports and town squares, just so families wouldn't be separated. So another classroom wouldn't get shot up, so our kids wouldn't grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We've seen Americans all races joining together to declare in the faceof injustice that black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. We've seen folks, our essential workers, our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else's loved ones. We see that what is best in us is still there, but we've got to give it voice, and we've got to do it now. So let's get to work people. Let's bring this home. I love you, Philadelphia. Honk if you're fired up, honk if you're ready to go.
